### Deprecated
This project in no longer in development.  It was horribly coded in a language I rarely use now.  I don't even think it works.  If anyone cares enough to make a pull request, I will probably accept it.

### Requirements
Requires Pip (Optional but good for easy install), Pygame (pygame.org or pip install pygame), and googletrans (Required for languages other than English, pip install googletrans.)
